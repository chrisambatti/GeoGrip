<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


# Address Updater Project üè†

## Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è
The Address Updater project is a simple web application designed to manage address information. It provides users with functionalities to add, edit, and delete addresses, as well as view a list of existing addresses.

## Functionality üõ†Ô∏è
- **Add Address**: Users can add new addresses by entering complete information such as street address, city, state, and zip code. The system validates user input for completeness and format and handles potential duplicate entries.
- **Edit Address**: Existing addresses can be edited, allowing users to make changes to address details. The system ensures all address fields are editable and prevents invalid data during editing.
- **Delete Address**: Unwanted addresses can be deleted with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletion. The system also handles potential data dependencies before deletion.
- **Update Address**: Users can update existing addresses in real-time, with changes immediately reflected in the interface. The system handles potential conflicts during updates, such as concurrent edits by multiple users.

## Usage üöÄ
